## Getting Started

### Desktop vs Web: Which Should You Use?

**Desktop (Windows/Mac)** offers the full feature set including Presenter View, custom animations, slide masters, advanced design tools, and complete printing options.

**Web Version** is great for quick edits and real-time collaboration but lacks Presenter View, custom animations, password protection, embedded video playback, and precision tools like rulers and gridlines.

**Recommendation:** Use desktop for creating and presenting. Use web for quick edits and collaboration on the go.

### Understanding the Interface

PowerPoint's interface consists of:

- **Ribbon:** Top menu bar with tabs (Home, Insert, Design, etc.)
- **Slide Pane:** Main editing area in the center
- **Thumbnail Pane:** Left sidebar showing all slides
- **Notes Pane:** Bottom area for speaker notes

*Platform notes: Access ribbon with Alt key (Windows) or use menu bar shortcuts on Mac*

### Creating Your First Presentation

1. Open PowerPoint and choose a theme or blank presentation
2. Add slides using the New Slide button or `Ctrl+M` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
3. Choose appropriate layouts for each slide
4. Add content: text, images, shapes
5. Save regularly using `Ctrl+S` (Windows) / `Cmd+S` (Mac)

## Essentials / Core Concepts

### Content First, Design Second

The golden rule: **always plan your content before designing**. Write your outline or script in a Word document first. This helps organize ideas and create the correct narrative sequence.

Only after you know what you're saying should you focus on how it looks.

### Slide Layouts and Masters

**Layouts** are pre-designed slide templates that control where content appears. Change layout via Home tab → Layout.

**Slide Masters** define the overall look (fonts, colors, positioning) for your entire presentation. Editing the master updates all slides automatically.

*Platform notes: Slide Master editing only available in desktop versions*

### Themes vs Templates

**Theme:** A color palette and font set that gives your presentation a consistent look. Can be applied to any presentation.

**Template:** A complete presentation file with pre-designed slides, content suggestions, and a theme. Start with these for inspiration but customize to avoid looking generic.

**Tip:** Avoid using default PowerPoint designs as-is—they make presentations look thrown together last minute.

### Format Painter: Your Consistency Tool

The Format Painter lets you copy formatting from one object to another, speeding up your design workflow dramatically.

- **Single use:** `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V`
- **Multiple use:** Double-click Format Painter

*Platform notes: Mac uses Cmd+Shift+C / Cmd+Shift+V*

### Alignment and Positioning

PowerPoint has no built-in keyboard shortcuts for alignment. Instead, use the alignment tools:

- Select objects → Format tab → Align dropdown
- Enable gridlines and guides (View tab) for precision
- Use Smart Guides (automatic) that appear when dragging objects

**Why it matters:** Precisely aligned slides signal professionalism and attention to detail.

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Presentation from Scratch

1. **Plan your content:** Write an outline or script in Word to organize your ideas
2. **Create structure:** Open PowerPoint and create blank slides for each main point
3. **Choose a theme:** Apply a professional theme from Design tab (avoid defaults)
4. **Add content:** Fill in text, keeping it minimal—slides are visual aids, not documents
5. **Insert visuals:** Add high-quality images, charts, or diagrams to support your points
6. **Apply consistent formatting:** Use Format Painter to maintain visual consistency
7. **Add transitions:** Use simple transitions between slides (avoid overuse)
8. **Review and refine:** Check alignment, spelling, and flow

### Designing Consistent Slides

1. **Choose your base style:** Select fonts, colors, and spacing for one slide
2. **Use Format Painter:** Copy formatting to similar elements across slides
3. **Enable alignment tools:** Turn on gridlines (View → Gridlines)
4. **Align objects:** Select multiple objects → Format → Align → choose option
5. **Check consistency:** Review all slides in Slide Sorter view
6. **Update master:** For presentation-wide changes, edit the Slide Master

### Delivering a Presentation

1. **Add speaker notes:** Write reminders in the Notes pane below each slide
2. **Practice with Presenter View:** Rehearse using `Alt+F5` to see notes and timer
3. **Check your setup:** Test projector/screen connection before presenting
4. **Start the show:** Press `F5` from first slide or `Shift+F5` from current
5. **Navigate smoothly:** Use N/P keys or arrow keys to move between slides
6. **Use B/W keys:** Black or white out the screen when taking questions
7. **End gracefully:** Press `Esc` to exit or advance past last slide

*Platform notes: Presenter View only available in desktop versions (Windows/Mac)*

### Collaborating on Presentations

1. **Save to cloud:** Store file in OneDrive or SharePoint for easy sharing
2. **Share access:** Click Share button and add collaborators
3. **Edit together:** Multiple people can edit simultaneously (web or desktop)
4. **Use comments:** Add comments for feedback without changing content
5. **Review changes:** Check version history to see who changed what
6. **Finalize:** Once complete, download a final copy for presenting offline

## Tips & Gotchas

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too much text:** Keep text minimal (6-8 lines max per slide). Use visuals to convey information.
- **Reading slides word-for-word:** Your slides should support your talk, not be your talk.
- **Tiny fonts:** Never go below 24pt font size. If it doesn't fit, simplify or split into multiple slides.
- **Using default templates as-is:** Everyone recognizes default PowerPoint designs. Customize them.
- **Poor alignment:** Sloppy alignment makes your work look unprofessional. Use alignment tools.
- **Overcrowded slides:** Leave white space. It helps audience focus on what matters.
- **Low-quality images:** Blurry photos on large screens look terrible. Use high-resolution images.
- **Spelling errors:** A single typo can undermine your credibility. Proofread carefully.

### Platform-Specific Limitations

**Web version cannot:**

- Use Presenter View (desktop only)
- Create or modify custom animations (can view existing ones)
- Open password-protected presentations
- Play embedded videos
- Edit Slide Masters
- Print with full options (notes pages, handouts)

**Mac differences:**

- Fewer shortcuts available than Windows (but can create custom ones)
- Some Windows shortcuts use Control key on Mac (not all use Cmd)
- No Alt-based KeyTips for ribbon access

### Best Practices for Design

- **One idea per slide:** Don't cram multiple concepts together
- **High contrast:** Ensure text is easily readable against background
- **Consistent spacing:** Keep margins and padding uniform across slides
- **Limit colors:** Stick to 2-3 main colors plus black/white
- **Simple transitions:** Fade or None—fancy transitions distract
- **Quality over quantity:** 10 focused slides beat 30 cluttered ones

### Presentation Delivery Tips

- **Practice with Presenter View:** Get comfortable seeing notes while audience sees slides
- **Arrive early:** Test equipment and fix any technical issues before audience arrives
- **Know your transitions:** Don't be surprised by animations or builds during live delivery
- **Have a backup:** Save your presentation in multiple formats (PPTX, PDF) on multiple devices
- **Learn the keyboard shortcuts:** Navigating with keys looks more professional than clicking

### Quick Fixes for Common Issues

- **Slides won't advance:** Check if you're in Edit mode instead of Presentation mode
- **Animations not playing:** Unsupported animations in web version—use desktop
- **Text looks different:** Font not installed on presenting computer—use common fonts or embed fonts
- **Objects misaligned:** Use Format → Align → Align to Slide for consistent positioning
- **Lost speaker notes:** Notes pane might be collapsed—drag bottom border up to expand
